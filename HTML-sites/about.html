                <p>Felix is a former student of Lyn's at Kimball union Academy.  He graduated from KUA 2011 and recieved a BA in Media Studies from Vassar College in 2015.  His focus was on the philosophy of digital media, and he wrote his thesis critiquing the ways the russian formalist school of literary analysis has been adapted to videogames.  Since graduating he has helped Lyn develop several teaching units involving games, which can now be found through the <a href="http://store.circuiboardeducation.com">Circuitboard Education Store</a>.  He routinely visits Lyn's classroom and manages servers and setup for several projects.  Felix is a concrete and careful planner, with experience in a broad array of new media fields.  Both an avid student and teacher, his affinity for detailed planning alongside his penchant for big-picture thinking makes him the natural partner to Lyn's forward-looking enthusiasm.</p>
